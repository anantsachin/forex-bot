    "bot_response": "Increasing the win rate from 45.45% to 80% is a significant goal. Here's what needs to be considered:\n\n*   **Realism:** Achieving an 80% win rate consistently in Forex is extremely difficult and may not be realistic with most trading strategies. High win rates often come at the expense of risk/reward ratio.\n\n*   **Strategy Review:** The current strategy needs thorough analysis. The low win rate suggests potential issues with entry/exit criteria, risk management, or market conditions.\n\n*   **Backtesting/Optimization:** Backtest the strategy on historical data to identify weaknesses and optimize parameters. Focus on improving the accuracy of entries and exits.\n\n*   **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Evaluate the risk/reward ratio. A higher win rate often implies a lower risk/reward. Determine if the potential profits justify the risk taken.\n\n*   **Market Conditions:** Adapt the strategy to different market conditions (trending vs. ranging). Some strategies perform better in specific environments.\n\n*   **Trade Score Analysis:** Review the trade scores, filter on low score trades to identify if the bot is taking bad setups. \n\n*   **Stop-Loss Optimization:** Consider tightening stop-loss levels to reduce losses on losing trades, but be mindful of potential \"whipsaws\" that can prematurely close positions. But this could impact the current risk reward of the active trades.\n\nGiven the current data, the immediate focus should be on understanding why the recent EURGBP trades resulted in substantial losses. This could indicate a problem with the strategy's performance on that specific pair or a shift in market dynamics.\n",
